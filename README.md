Steps on how to create a GitHub page:
<ul>
  <li>First, you need to create a basic template for your GitHub page.</li>
  <li>After creating your template, re-write your content and design as it is.</li>
  <li>After designing your page, make sure that your HTML file follows the name "index.html" for it to be discovered later in the deployment stage.</li>
  <li>Perform the necessary operation in creating your repository and pushing your files.</li>
  <li>Then, in your repository, go to your settings, and go to your Page tab.</li>
  <li>Make sure that you are in your working branch, and in your /root folder (keep note that this may vary according to users).</li>
  <li>Wait for a few minutes, and check your GitHub page by going to your username.github.io/<your-repository></li>
</ul>

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?:

I found out that creating an HTML website, or the front end of a website, is hard. Many people look at the front end to be easier than it is. But in reality, it is not. You need the necessary skills,
creativity, and patience to create a website that will be appealing to the users who will use your website.
